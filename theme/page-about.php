            <p>Too often, eye care is reduced to rushed visits, checklist symptoms, and profit-driven decisions. Many practices are run with little regard for patients or the clinicians providing care. Appointments are cut short, staff are treated as expendable, and the result is predictable: patients get less than they deserve.</p>
            <p dir="ltr"><br>&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;Zellig was created as a response. We bring together the best providers, give them the time and support they need, and create an environment where their work is respected. When clinicians are valued, patients feel the difference.</p>
            <p dir="ltr"><br>We also aim to offer the full spectrum of mental-health care&mdash;psychiatry, counseling, and beyond&mdash;delivered in a setting that looks at patients as whole people, not just medication lists or symptom checkboxes. Our integrative approach means we go further to understand each individual and craft treatment plans in true collaboration.</p>
            <p dir="ltr"><br>Zellig is built on the idea that when care is thoughtful, unrushed, and grounded in respect for both patients and clinicians, the results are better for everyone.</p>
